Description:
    Stubs out a new MapFish controller and its views. Pass the controller name,
    either CamelCased or under_scored.

    To create a controller within a module, specify the controller name as a
    path like 'parent_module/controller_name'.

    This generates a controller class in app/controllers, a sample configuration
    config/print.yaml and invokes helper and test framework generators.

Example:
    `rails generate mapfish:print_controller Print`
