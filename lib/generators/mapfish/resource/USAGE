Description:
    Scaffolds an entire MapFish resource, from model and migration to controller,
    along with a full test suite.

    Pass the singular model name, either CamelCased or under_scored, as the
    first argument, and an optional list of attribute pairs.

    Attribute pairs are field:type arguments specifying the
    model's attributes. Timestamps are added by default, so you don't have to
    specify them by hand as 'created_at:datetime updated_at:datetime'.

    You don't have to think up every attribute up front, but it helps to
    sketch out a few so you can start working with the model immediately.

    This generator invokes your configured ORM and test framework, besides
    creating helpers and add routes to config/routes.rb.

Examples:
    `rails generate mapfish::resource post` # no attributes
    `rails generate mapfish::resource post title:string body:text published:boolean`
    `rails generate mapfish::resource weather_station name:string position:point`
